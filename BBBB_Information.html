<h3>Daily Monitoring of Sanitation for Better Sanitized Bathrooms</h3>
<p>We aim to improve the hygiene quality in our bathrooms by monitoring the cleanliness of it daily. Hygiene is an 
important thing in a community which could really characterize them. By improving their hygiene quality, we are able to lower
the risk the spread of bacteria and viruses. Additionally, improve users' experience as well. We plan to monitor the bathrooms
every Sunday in the middle of the afternoon around 2PM up to 4PM (covers all bathroom stalls) by which some stalls will be unaccesible 
maximize the thorough cleaning.</p>

<h3>Attempt to Provide a Touch-free Experience</h3>
<p>Obviously, some bacteria or viruses spread through touch, and with the bathrooms especially public ones being quite dirty, we aim to provide users 
a touch-free exprience. This means we shall try to install systems like automatic soap dispenser, Auto Hand Dryer, Flush sensors, etc.
We may also provide gloves that people may use in case they have to touch something.</p>

<h3>Eliminate Foul Oder Orginating from the Bathroom</h3>
<p>In all honesty, no one likes the foul oder coming from the bathroom, especially us here at the 3B Business, so we aim to eliminate
any foul oder present coming from the stalls. We plan to do this by using the previously said goal which is flush sensors to immediatly 
flush the toilets. Installing humidifiers as well in the bathrooms would also decrease any foul oder.</p>

<h3>Make Them more Accesible to the Public</h3>
<p>Sometimes, bathroom are hard to come by since they are mostly in a private building and everyone needs to go
to the bathroom, so this goal aims to make bathroom more accesible to all. We plan to add more bathroom stall Public Areas as to 
provide them for the people, also includes Unisex Bathrooms and PWD bathrooms to help those
in need. </p>

<h3>Install Urinal Systems like Bidets and Soap Dispensers</h3>
<p>Ensuring a hygienic and convenient bathroom experience is crucial, hence our focus on installing advanced urinal systems such as bidets and automatic soap dispensers. 
Bidets offer a more sanitary and gentle alternative to toilet paper, reducing the risk of irritation and the spread of germs. Automatic soap dispensers minimize contact 
and ensure that everyone can clean their hands thoroughly, which is essential for maintaining public health. By integrating these systems, we aim to elevate the standard
of bathroom hygiene and user comfort significantly.</p>

<p>Look at this distinguised gentlemen walk towards our beatiful new clean bathrooms:</p>

<h3>Improve the Mood of the Bathrooms by Addding Lights and Music</h3>
<p>Ambiance plays a key role in the overall experience of using a bathroom. To transform ordinary bathrooms into spaces where people feel relaxed and uplifted, 
we plan to introduce ambient lighting and background music. Soft, warm lighting can make the space feel welcoming and clean, while a carefully selected playlist of 
calming music can enhance the user's comfort and reduce stress. This approach not only improves the mood of the bathrooms but also positively impacts the users' 
perception of cleanliness and sophistication of the facilities.</p>

<h3>Orient the People of Proper Bathroom Etiquette</h3>
<p>Promoting proper bathroom etiquette is essential for maintaining cleanliness and ensuring a pleasant experience for all users. We plan to launch an educational 
campaign that includes signage and digital content to remind and teach the community about key aspects of bathroom etiquette. This will cover practices such as 
flushing after use, washing hands properly, respecting privacy, and proper disposal of waste. By fostering a culture of respect and consideration, we can enhance the 
communal bathroom experience and ensure that these spaces remain clean, comfortable, and accessible to everyone.</p>
